#  Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies course assignments
 
This repository contains my solution to the assignments in the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies course. The assignments tackled various concepts and challenges related to cryptocurrencies, including Scroogecoin, consensus algorithms, and blockchain technology.

## Assignments

1. **Scroogecoin**: In this assignment, I implemented the basic features of a cryptocurrency system based on the Scroogecoin model. The implementation includes transaction verification, block creation, and maintaining a distributed ledger. The code can be found in the `scroogecoin` directory.

2. **Consensus**: The consensus assignment focused on exploring different consensus algorithms used in blockchain networks. I studied and implemented a consensus algorithm, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). The code and any related documentation can be found in the `consensus` directory.

3. **Blockchain**: This assignment delved into the fundamental principles of blockchain technology. I analyzed data structures, cryptographic techniques, and decentralized consensus protocols. The implementation of blockchain-related components, such as Merkle trees, block propagation, and transaction validation, can be found in the `blockchain` directory.
